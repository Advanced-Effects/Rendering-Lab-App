# thirdparty/glad

- The GLAD library surges out of the **need** to **pull OpenGL functions**.
- In OpenGL, unlike in other libraries, one needs to **manuallly fetch the functions you need** because **every graphics device implements OpenGL differently.**
- The **syntax** to do that is **ugly** and **OS-specific**, that's **why we use glad** instead.
- You can **get glad** from here: https://glad.dav1d.de/
